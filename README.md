# Introduction
This project serves as a comprehensive data analysis case study using an e-commerce inventory dataset collected from Zepto, one of India’s leading quick-commerce companies. It replicates real-world analytical processes, covering stages from data collection and cleaning to in-depth, business-focused analysis.
# Project Overview
The project aims to simulate the practical workflow of data analysts in e-commerce and retail contexts through the use of SQL. It involves:

✅ Creating and structuring a raw e-commerce inventory database

✅ Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends in product categories, availability, and pricing accuracy

✅ Executing Data Cleaning procedures to manage missing or invalid values and normalize price units

✅ Writing analytical SQL queries to generate insights on pricing, inventory levels, product availability, and revenue performance

# Tools used
This project leveraged the following tools for analyzing the data analyst job market:
- **SQL** for querying and insight extraction.
- **PostgreSQL** as the database management system.
- **Visual Studio Code** for SQL execution and database handling.
- **Git & GitHub** for version control and collaborative management of scripts and findings.

# Conclusion

### Insights
- Found top 10 best-value products based on discount percentage
- Identified high-MRP products that are currently out of stock
- Estimated potential revenue for each product category
- Filtered expensive products (MRP > ₹500) with minimal discount
- Ranked top 5 categories offering highest average discounts
- Calculated price per gram to identify value-for-money products
- Grouped products based on weight into Low, Medium, and Bulk categories
- Measured total inventory weight per product category

### Closing Thoughts
This project enhanced my SQL skills and provided practical exposure to real-world data extraction and querying processes. While performing data cleaning and transformation, I encountered various challenges that deepened my understanding of data handling. I also learned several new SQL techniques and improved my competence in managing relational databases.
